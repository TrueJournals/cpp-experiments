C++ Experiments
===============

A simple repo to contain code for anytime I have something I want to try out in
C++.  This could basically be anything, even stupid little examples that may
seem obvious afterwords.  Each folder will contain a different test/demo.

Probably nothing groundbreaking in here, but maybe something slightly
interesting.
